This was a Unity Simulation that I made for a Thrustmaster 16000m Joystick and an Arduino-Mega.
Both the Unity project and Arduino config files have been included.

-- Please look into the Documentation folder for further documentation

Note: You may have to deactivate Uduino to run the project if you are trying to use it without an Arduino.
